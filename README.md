# Math Notation
Some equation in LaTeX format

## Reactance

Capacitive 

$$X_c = \dfrac{1}{2\pi fC}$$

Inductive

$$X_L = 2\pi fL$$

## SWR

$$SWR = \dfrac{1 +  |\Gamma |}{1 - |\Gamma |}$$

where

$$\Gamma = \dfrac{Z_L - Z_o}{Z_L + Z_o}$$

## Inline 

This is an inline formula $V = IR$ as is $P = I^2R$

And the greatest of all is $e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0$
